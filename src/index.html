        <p class="resume">
          In her early twenties and still positive about life. Her mind is
          super fast and great with connecting the dots, and she'll probably need to pause a few conversations to finish
          some thoughts. With some remarkable facts in her journey like a conservative upbringing, late sexual discovery
          and some professional failures, she feels good. But she can't fit in anywhere. And that's exhausting.

        <img class="img" src="./assets/silhueta.png" alt="character silhoette">

        <h3 class="caracteristicas">Intuitive | Resilient | Strong</h3>
        <p class="resume">
          She feels on a road with a dead end. In her mid fifties, she has a family back home. She loves them a lot, but
          she's reached a point where her problems are not actually hers, and that's friggin' heavy. She's completely
          weary, but has a powerful life drive buried underneath it all. Too modest to say it, everything she decides to
          touch becomes beautiful and joyful. Her intuition works better than a satellite, so if she can hear it, she'd
          probably see her road is long and dynamic.
        </p>

        <h3 class="caracteristicas">Observant | Leader | Witty</h3>
        <p class="resume">
          She's resilient, pragmatic, and got a taste
          for
          tattoos. One of her favorites is the " 100% " one, meaning: I've survived 100% of my worst days. Once she
          found
          real love, and that brought light to her journey, but her love is not among us anymore. So that's why you'll
          probably see her talking to emptiness from now and then. Some say she's a radical, but she prefers to describe
          herself as someone tired who just decided to retaliate.
